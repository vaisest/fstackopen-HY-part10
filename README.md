Differences from the course material:

- Expo v51 because v50 crashed instantly on my android phone
- Eslint json migrated, because:
  > ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file.
  > From ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is now eslint.config.js.
- API part: after being unable to install apollo and graphql due to a version mismatch, I upgraded everything to the latest version
- Jest ignores `./rate-repository-app`
- "react-test-renderer": "^19.2.0"
